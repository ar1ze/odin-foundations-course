#### Question: What kind of program is Git?

**Answer:** Git is a **Version Control System** (VCS).

**Why:** It's a program that tracks changes to your project's files over time. This allows you to save "snapshots" of your work, view the history of changes, and revert to older versions if needed.

**Remember:** Git is like a "save" button for your project's entire history, not just for a single file. üìñ

#### Question: What are the differences between Git and a text editor in terms of what they save and their record keeping?

**Answer:** A **text editor** saves the current state of a file, overwriting its previous state. **Git** saves a historical record of "snapshots" (called commits) of your entire project, keeping track of who changed what, and when.

**Why:** A text editor only cares about what the file looks like *right now*. Git cares about every change that has ever happened in the project's lifetime, creating a detailed log.

**Example:** Saving in a text editor is like having one save slot in a video game that you keep overwriting. Using Git is like having unlimited, timestamped save slots that you can return to at any time.

#### Question: Does Git work at a local or remote level?

**Answer:** Git works at a **local** level.

**Why:** Your entire project history is stored in a hidden `.git` folder directly on your computer. You can create commits and view history without an internet connection.

#### Question: Does GitHub work at a local or remote level?

**Answer:** GitHub works at a **remote** level.

**Why:** It's a website that hosts your Git projects (repositories) online. This provides a backup for your code and allows you to share and collaborate with other developers.

**Remember:** **Git** = on your machine (local). **GitHub** = on the internet (remote). üíª‚û°Ô∏è‚òÅÔ∏è

#### Question: Why is Git useful for developers?

**Answer:** Git is useful because it acts as a safety net. It allows you to experiment with new ideas in isolated branches without fear of breaking your main project, and you can easily revert to a previous working state if you make a mistake.

**Why:** This freedom to experiment and easily undo errors makes the development process much safer and more efficient.

#### Question: Why are Git and GitHub useful for a team of developers?

**Answer:** Git and GitHub allow a team to work on the same codebase at the same time without interfering with each other's work.

**Why:** GitHub provides a central, shared repository for the project. Git allows each developer to work on features independently and then merge their changes back into the main project in an organized way, keeping track of who made each change.

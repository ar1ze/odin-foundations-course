# Introduction to Git üíª

---

### **Foundations Course**

* **What is Git?** Git is a **version control system** that acts as an "epic save button" for files and directories, recording the differences between saves and keeping a historical record of each one.

* **Git vs. Text Editor:**
    * **Text Editor:** Saves all words as a single file (`essay.doc`). Making copies (`essay-draft1.doc`) is manual and hard to track.
    * **Git:** Records **differences** and maintains a historical record of each save, allowing you to review and restore past file states.

* **Git vs. GitHub:**
    * **Git:** Works on your **local machine** üñ•Ô∏è.
    * **GitHub:** A **remote storage facility** on the web for your projects.

* **Why Learn Git & GitHub?**
    * **Individual Developer:** Allows you to track project growth and restore past versions.
    * **Collaboration:** Enables sharing and collaborating with other developers by pushing projects to platforms like GitHub.
    * **Career:** Using Git is an essential skill, and a GitHub portfolio provides proof of your capabilities to future employers.

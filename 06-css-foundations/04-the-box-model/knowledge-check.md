#### Question: From inside to outside, what is the order of box-model properties?

**Answer:** The order from the inside out is: **Content**, **Padding**, **Border**, **Margin**.

**Why:** The content is the innermost part. Padding adds space around the content but inside the border. The border is the edge of the box. Margin adds space outside the border, pushing other elements away.

**Remember:** Think of a framed picture. The **content** is the photo, **padding** is the matting, the **border** is the frame, and the **margin** is the space between it and other pictures on the wall. üñºÔ∏è

#### Question: What does the `box-sizing` CSS property do?

**Answer:** The **`box-sizing`** property changes how the browser calculates the total width and height of an element.

**Why:** It lets you decide if the `width` and `height` properties you set should apply only to the content box, or if they should include the padding and border as well.

#### Question: What is the difference between the standard and alternative box model?

**Answer:** In the **standard model** (`content-box`), the `width` and `height` you set applies *only* to the content. In the **alternative model** (`border-box`), the `width` and `height` applies to the content, padding, and border *combined*.

**Why:** The alternative model (`border-box`) is often easier to work with because the element's final size on the page directly matches the dimensions you set in your CSS, regardless of the padding or border size.

**Example:** For a box with `width: 100px` and `padding: 10px`:

  * **Standard:** The final visible width is 120px (100px content + 20px padding).
  * **Alternative:** The final visible width is 100px (the content area shrinks to make room for the padding).

#### Question: Would you use `margin` or `padding` to create more space between 2 elements?

**Answer:** You would use **`margin`**.

**Why:** Margin exists *outside* an element's border and is used to create space between neighboring elements.

#### Question: Would you use `margin` or `padding` to create more space between the contents of an element and its border?

**Answer:** You would use **`padding`**.

**Why:** Padding exists *inside* an element's border, creating a buffer between the content and the edge of the box.

#### Question: Would you use `margin` or `padding` if you wanted two elements to overlap each other?

**Answer:** You would use a negative **`margin`**.

**Why:** While a positive margin pushes elements apart, a negative margin pulls them closer together, which can cause them to overlap.

#### Question: How do you set the alternative box model for all of your elements?

**Answer:** You apply `box-sizing: border-box;` to all elements and pseudo-elements using a universal selector rule at the top of your stylesheet.

**Why:** This CSS "reset" is a best practice that makes layouts much more predictable and easier to manage across your entire project.

**Example:**

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

#### Question: How do you center an element horizontally?

**Answer:** For a block-level element, you must first give it a **`width`**, and then set its left and right margins to **`auto`**.

**Why:** Setting horizontal margins to `auto` tells the browser to automatically divide the available empty space equally between the left and right sides of the element, pushing it into the center of its container.

**Example:**

```css
.my-element {
  width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto; /* Shorthand for top/bottom 0, left/right auto */
}
```

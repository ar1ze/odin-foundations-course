# Text Editors: Foundations Course

## üí° Introduction
***
A text editor is an essential tool for developers. A good one helps you write better code with real-time checking, syntax highlighting, and automatic formatting.

### ‚ùì Why not use Microsoft Word?
Rich text editors like Microsoft Word are unsuitable for code because they embed extra formatting information. Plain text editors like VSCode save only the text, which is necessary for programs to read and execute the file as code.

## üíª Code Editors
***
Code editors are specialized, highly customizable web development tools. They offer features like plugins, syntax highlighting, and auto-closing of brackets, which prevent common errors.

### üéØ Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
VSCode is a free and excellent code editor. It's the most popular choice among Odin students and moderators due to its great add-on and Git integration support.

* **Note:** For this course, it is assumed you'll be using VSCode because it's free, easy to use, and works consistently across operating systems.

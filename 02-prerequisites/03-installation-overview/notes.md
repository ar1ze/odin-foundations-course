# üõ†Ô∏è Installation Overview

### **Introduction**
---
* The first step in building a website is having the right tools: a development environment.
* While in-browser editors ("sandboxes") are great for quick starts, operating in a real development environment is key for long-term success.
* Setting up a development environment can be frustrating but is an invaluable, real-world skill.

### **Lesson Overview**
---
* This lesson provides a general overview of supported operating systems (OS).
* Specific installation instructions are in the next lesson. You do not need to install anything just yet.

### **OS Options**
---
#### **üçé macOS**
* A Unix-based system, which is what The Odin Project's instructions assume.
* You will be ready to go after installing just a few programs.

#### **üêß Linux (Official Ubuntu flavors)**
* Free and open-source, works well with all programming languages.
* Most development tools are built for Linux, providing better performance and troubleshooting information.
* The curriculum uses Ubuntu or Xubuntu.
* It is the recommended OS if you are not using a Mac.

#### **üíª Windows**
* **Not natively supported** by The Odin Project or its Discord server.
* You will need to set up a Linux environment within Windows.
* **Options for Windows users (detailed in the next lesson):**
    * **VirtualBox Virtual Machine:** An emulation of another OS running inside Windows. Easy to install and risk-free.
    * **Dual-boot Ubuntu installation:** Installing both Linux and Windows on your computer. Offers better performance as Linux can use all system resources.
    * **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2):** Runs a full Linux environment from within Windows with a simplified installation process.

#### ** Chromebook**
* You may be able to run a Linux terminal. More details are in the next lesson.

### **ü§î Concerned About Installing a New OS?**
---
* You don't have to get rid of Windows; Linux can share the hard drive.
* Most consumer OSs make it difficult to use developer tools, which can cause new developers to give up.
* Dual-booting or modifying your computer to work with these tools will create a distraction-free environment and look good on a resume.

### **üöÄ Reasons to Install Linux**
---
* **Tested:** The directions are tested with macOS, Ubuntu, and WSL2 to get you coding faster.
* **Community Support:** Using recommended tools makes it easier for the community to help with troubleshooting.
* **Development Tools are Built for Linux:** Popular technologies like Ruby on Rails and Node.js are open-source and expect to run on a Unix-based platform like Linux.
* **Work Like The Pros:** Many professional developers use a Unix-based OS.
* **Performance:** Linux uses fewer system resources and less hard drive space than Windows.

### **Important Note**
---
* **The Odin Project only supports what is provided within the curriculum.**
* **Native Windows is not a supported development environment.** Do not ask for support for Windows in the Discord server.

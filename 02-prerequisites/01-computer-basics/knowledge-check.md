#### Question: Give an example of a weak and a strong password.

**Answer:** A weak password is short and easy to guess, while a strong password is long, complex, and unpredictable.

**Why:** Strong passwords combine uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols, which makes them exponentially harder for automated programs to crack.

**Example:**
* **Weak:** `Soccer2025`
* **Strong:** `bLue-Gir@ffe-Jumped-7-t!mes`

**Remember:** Think of a **strong password** as a short, memorable, and random phrase.

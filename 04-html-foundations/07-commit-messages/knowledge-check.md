#### Question: What are two benefits of having well-written commit messages and a good commit history?

**Answer:** Two major benefits are making your project **easier to review** and **simpler to debug**.

**Why:** A clean commit history acts as a project diary, allowing anyone (including your future self) to quickly understand why a change was made. When a bug appears, a well-documented history helps you pinpoint exactly which change might have caused the problem, saving you a lot of time.

**Remember:** Good commits are like a clear project storybook. ðŸ“–

#### Question: How many characters should the subject line of your commit message be?

**Answer:** The subject line should be **50 characters or less**.

**Why:** This is a widely-accepted convention that keeps commit logs concise and easy to read at a glance. Tools like GitHub often truncate subject lines longer than this, so keeping it short ensures your full message is visible.

**Remember:** **50 characters max** for a clean, scannable subject line.

### **HTML and CSS** üíª
***
HTML and CSS are two languages that work together to create everything that you see when you look at something on the internet.

- **HTML:** The raw data a webpage is built out of. All text, links, cards, lists, and buttons are created in HTML.
- **CSS:** Adds style to plain elements. It positions information, gives it color, changes the font, and makes it look great!

While many resources refer to them as programming languages, they are not, as they are only concerned with presenting information and not used to program logic. **JavaScript**, which you will learn next, is a programming language used to make webpages do things.

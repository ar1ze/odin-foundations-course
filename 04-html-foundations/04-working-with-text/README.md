# Working with Text

### Introduction

📄 Most web content is text-based, so it's important to know how to work with HTML text elements. This lesson covers the most common ones.

***

### Lesson Overview

-   **Paragraphs**: How to create them using `<p>`.
-   **Headings**: How to use `<h1>` to `<h6>` for different levels of hierarchy.
-   **Bold & Italic Text**: The difference between `<strong>` and `<em>` and their semantic meaning.
-   **Nesting**: Understanding parent, child, and sibling relationships between elements.
-   **Comments**: How to use `` for notes in your code.

### Paragraphs

⚠️ Browsers compress new lines and spaces into a single space, clumping text together.

✅ Use the `<p>` element to create a new line after each paragraph, ensuring proper formatting.

***

### Headings

⬆️ Headings are larger and bolder than regular text and are used to signify importance.

🔢 There are 6 levels of headings: `<h1>` (most important) to `<h6>` (least important).

✍️ Headings provide a hierarchy for the page content, with `<h1>` being the main title.

### Strong Element

💪 The `<strong>` element makes text **bold**.

🗣️ It also semantically marks text as **important**, which can affect screen readers.

-   Example: `<strong>Important text</strong>`

***

### Em Element

✍️ The `<em>` element makes text *italic*.

🗣️ It semantically adds **emphasis** to the text, which can also affect screen readers.

-   Example: `<em>Emphasized text</em>`

***

### Nesting and Indentation

➡️ **Nesting** is placing elements inside other elements.

-   **Parent**: The outer element.
-   **Child**: The nested element.

➡️ Elements at the same level of nesting are **siblings**.

🧹 Use **indentation** (e.g., 2 spaces per level) to make your code clear and readable.

### HTML Comments

📝 **HTML comments** are not visible in the browser.

🧑‍💻 They are used to add notes to your code for yourself or other developers.

-   Example: ``

### Assignment

-   **Watch**: Kevin Powell’s videos on HTML Paragraph and Headings, and HTML Bold and Italic Text.
-   **Practice**: Create a blog article page using different headings, paragraphs, and text formatting (`<strong>` and `<em>`).
-   **Tip**: Use the VS Code shortcut to generate dummy text with `lorem`.

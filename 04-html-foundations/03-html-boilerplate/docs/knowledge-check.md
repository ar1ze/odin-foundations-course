#### Question: What is the purpose of the doctype declaration?

**Answer:** The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration is an instruction that tells the web browser the document is an **HTML5** page.

**Remember:** It's the document's "birth certificate," telling the browser its type and age. ðŸ“œ

#### Question: What is the HTML element?

#### Question: What is the purpose of the head element?

**Answer:** The `<head>` element is a container for **metadata** (data about the HTML document) that is not displayed on the visible page.

**Why:** It holds important information for the browser and search engines, such as the page's `<title>` (which appears in the browser tab), links to CSS files, and character set information.

**Remember:** The **head** holds the "brains" and behind-the-scenes info of the page. ðŸ§

**Remember:** The **body** is what you *see* on the page. ðŸ‘€

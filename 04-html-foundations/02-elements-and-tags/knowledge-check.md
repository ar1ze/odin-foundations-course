#### Question: What is an HTML tag?

**Answer:** An **HTML tag** is a special keyword surrounded by angle brackets (`< >`) that tells the browser how to structure and display content.

**Why:** Tags are the fundamental building blocks of an HTML page. They label pieces of your contentâ€”like "this is a heading" or "this is a paragraph"â€”so the browser knows what to do with them.

**Example:** The `<p>` tag defines a paragraph, and the `<h1>` tag defines the most important heading.

#### Question: What are the three parts of an HTML element?

**Answer:** A typical HTML element consists of an **opening tag**, the **content**, and a **closing tag**.

**Why:** The opening tag turns an effect on (like "start paragraph"), the content is what's affected, and the closing tag turns the effect off (like "end paragraph").

**Example:** In `<strong>This text is bold.</strong>`:
1.  `<strong>` is the opening tag.
2.  `This text is bold.` is the content.
3.  `</strong>` is the closing tag.

**Remember:** **Open, Content, Close.**

#### Question: What are void elements, and how are they different from regular HTML elements?

**Answer:** **Void elements** (or self-closing elements) are a special type of HTML element that only consist of a single tag because they cannot contain any content.

**Why:** They are used to insert something into the document, not to wrap around it. Since they can't hold any content, they don't need a closing tag.

**Example:** The image tag (`<img src="cat.jpg">`) and the line-break tag (`<br>`) are common void elements.

**Remember:** Void elements are "void" of content and a closing tag.

HTML (**H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage) defines the structure and content of webpages. 🕸️ We use HTML elements for all content like paragraphs, headings, lists, images, and links.

### Elements and Tags

---

Most HTML elements are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags. 🏷️

- **Opening tags** `<p>`: Tell the browser where an element starts.
- **Closing tags** `</p>`: Tell the browser where an element ends (note the forward slash).
- **Example Element:** `<p>some text content</p>`

Elements are like containers for content. 📦

💡 Using the correct tags is called **semantic HTML**, which improves search engine ranking and accessibility.

### Void Elements

---

Some elements don't have a closing tag. They have a single tag like `<br>` or `<img>`.

- They are **"void"** of any content inside them. 🚫
- Also known as self-closing tags (e.g., `<br />`), though this is discouraged in the latest HTML specification.

# the-odin-project

Working through The Odin Project's full-stack curriculum to develop comprehensive web development skills. This repository contains my projects, exercises, and progress as I build from foundational concepts to advanced full-stack applications.

Having completed HTML and CSS fundamentals through MDN, I'm now expanding my learning with TOP's project-based approach that emphasizes real-world application and problem-solving skills.

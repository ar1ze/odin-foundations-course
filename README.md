# The Odin Project: Foundations Course

This repository documents my progress through The Odin Project's **Foundations curriculum**. The goal is to build a strong base in web development fundamentals, starting with core concepts and practical application.

I have completed the HTML and CSS fundamentals on MDN and am now using TOP's project-based approach to solidify these skills and learn additional topics such as JavaScript, Git, and the command line. This repository serves as a record of my projects, exercises, and overall learning journey.

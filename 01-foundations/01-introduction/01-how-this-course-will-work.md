# Introduction to Web Development 💻

---

What do web developers do? 🤔 They build and maintain websites. They typically work in a team to coordinate a client's needs into a final product. This work can be **front-end**, **back-end**, or **full-stack**.

Web development is a great profession if you enjoy solving logical problems, building useful things, and experimenting with new technologies. It's a field with high demand, good work-life balance, and comfortable salaries.

## Types of Web Developers 👩‍💻👨‍💻

---

* **Front-End:** 🎨 This is the part of the website you see in your browser. Front-end developers use **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to ensure content is presented effectively and users have a great experience.
* **Back-End:** ⚙️ This refers to the server-side "guts" of the application. Back-end developers use languages like **Java**, **Python**, **Ruby**, and **JavaScript** to store and serve data.
* **Full-Stack:** 🧱 These developers are comfortable working with both the front and back ends.

## Types of Careers 💼

---

* **Large Tech Companies:** 🏢 Offer excellent pay, benefits, and opportunities but have stringent hiring requirements.
* **Startups:** 🚀 Fast-paced environment that can feel like a "trial by fire." They may offer lower salaries and longer hours but could include company equity.
* **Freelancer:** 🤸‍♀️ Offers a strong hourly wage and freedom. However, you are responsible for finding work and managing billing.
* **Web Consultancy:** 🤝 Focus more on coding and less on the "hustle" of freelancing. This option provides a good work-life balance and pay.
* **Large, Older Companies:** 🐢 Offer good work-life balance, pay, and benefits but often move slower than tech-focused companies.

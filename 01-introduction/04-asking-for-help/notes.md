## Tips for Getting the Best Help Possible ✅

### **1. Always provide your code and the surrounding context** 🖥️

  * Include your code, error messages, terminal commands, server output, and other relevant details.
  * Provide as much context as possible and point to a specific function or line number.
  * Providing relevant info makes it easier for others to help you and avoids unnecessary back-and-forth conversation.
  * If you're asking a conceptual question, indicate it clearly.

### **2. Ask about the problem at hand, not the solution itself** 🤔

  * Instead of asking for the exact solution, describe the problem you're trying to solve.
  * A good example: "I'm trying to return a string that displays the winner in Rock Paper Scissors, but I'm getting a syntax error on line 12. How can I fix this? Here's my code."
  * This approach lets others debug your code and keeps you from having to start over.
  * If you're stuck on where to start, share your pseudo code.

### **3. Don’t take asking for more context to heart** ❤️

  * People who help in coding communities are volunteers, and they ask for more information to make sure they don't send you down the wrong path.
  * Trust their judgment and experience. They genuinely want to help you.

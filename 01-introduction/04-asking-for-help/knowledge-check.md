#### Question: What is the ‚ÄúXY Problem‚Äù?

**Answer:** The XY Problem is when you ask for help with your attempted **solution (Y)** instead of your actual underlying **problem (X)**.

**Why:** This makes it hard for others to help you effectively because they don't know your real goal. They might solve Y, but Y might be the wrong or a very inefficient way to solve X.

**Example:**
* **Problem X:** "I need to get the file extension from a filename."
* **Attempted Solution Y:** "How can I get the last 3 characters of a string?"
Asking about Y will get you answers about string manipulation, while asking about X will get you the correct, built-in method for handling file extensions.

**Remember:** Don't ask about your *fix* (Y), ask about your *problem* (X).

#### Question: What 5 things should your questions include?

**Answer:** A good question should include your **goal**, what you've already **tried**, what you **expected** to happen, what **actually happened** (the result, including any error messages), and the relevant **code**.

**Why:** Providing these five elements gives people all the context they need to understand your issue quickly and offer a helpful solution without wasting time asking for more information.

**Remember:** **Goal, Tried, Expected, Actual, Code.**

# Introduction to Web Development 💻

---

Web developers build and maintain websites. They typically work in teams on project-focused tasks for clients, which can include tech companies, organizations, or governments.

**Web development might be for you if you enjoy:**
* Solving logical problems
* Building useful things
* Experimenting with new technologies

Web developers are in high demand, generally have a good work-life balance, and earn comfortable salaries.

## Types of Web Developers 🌐

---

* **Front-end developers:** Work on the visible parts of a website (the user interface and content presentation). They use languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* **Back-end developers:** Work on the server side ("the guts of the application"). They store and serve data to the front end using programming languages such as Java, Python, and Ruby.
* **Full-stack developers:** Are skilled in both front-end and back-end development.

## Types of Careers 💼

---

* **Large Tech Companies:** Offer excellent pay, benefits, and opportunities but have stringent hiring requirements.
* **Startups:** Offer unique environments and may provide company equity, but often have lower salaries and require longer hours.
* **Freelancing:** Provides freedom and a strong hourly wage, but you are responsible for finding work, billing clients, and managing all aspects of the business.
* **Web Consultancies:** Offer a good work-life balance and pay, allowing you to focus more on coding and less on the "hustle."
* **Large, Older Companies:** Provide good pay, benefits, and work-life balance, but often move slower than tech-focused companies.

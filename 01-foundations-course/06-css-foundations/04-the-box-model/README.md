## The box model üß±

The first important concept that you need to understand to be successful in CSS is the box model.

* Every single thing on a webpage is a rectangular box.
* These boxes can have other boxes in them and can sit alongside one another.
* You can get a rough idea of how this works by applying an outline to every element on the page like this: `* { outline: 2px solid red; }`

There are many ways to manipulate the size of these boxes, and the space between them, using padding, border, and margin.

* **padding:** increases the space between the border of a box and the content of the box.
* **border:** adds space (even if it‚Äôs only a pixel or two) between the margin and the padding.
* **margin:** increases the space between the borders of a box and the borders of adjacent boxes.

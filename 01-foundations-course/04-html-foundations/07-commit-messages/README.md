### Why Are Commit Messages Important? 🤔

* **Job Applications:** 💼 Employers look at your commit history on GitHub. Good commits help you stand out as a novice developer.
* **Team Collaboration:** 👥 A good history allows you and other developers to quickly see what changes were made and why.
* **Future Self:** 🕰️ If you return to a project after a break, the commit history helps you remember your thought process.

### Bad vs. Good Commits 👎👍

* **Bad Example:** `fix a bug` (Too vague, lacks context).
* **Good Commit Principles:** A good commit message explains the "why" behind the changes and describes the problem solved.

### Effective Commits: Subject and Body 📖

* **Subject:** 📝 A brief summary of the change.
    * GitHub has a 72-character limit.
* **Body:** 📜 A concise but clear description of what you did.
    * Describe the problem and how you solved it.

**Example of a good commit:**

`Add missing link and alt text to the company's logo`

`Screen readers won't read the images to users with disabilities without this information.`

### How to Write a Multi-line Commit Message 💻

* Type `git commit` without the `-m` flag.
* This will open a text editor (like Visual Studio Code) where you can write a multi-line message.
* Save and close the tab to create the commit.

### When to Commit ⏰

* A commit is a "snapshot" of your code.
* **Best practice:** Commit every time you have a meaningful change.
* This creates a timeline of your progress.
* Good times to commit: getting a piece of code to function, fixing a typo, or fixing a bug.
* Committing early and often is a lifesaver if something breaks unexpectedly.

### Tips and Things to Remember 💡

* Use VS Code for easy multi-line messages, character count, and spell check.
* Use an **active voice**, e.g., "Fix card generator."
* Avoid vague messages like "saved" or "updated."
* **Commit early and often!**

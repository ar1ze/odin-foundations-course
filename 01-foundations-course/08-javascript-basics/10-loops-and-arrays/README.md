# Loops and Arrays: Foundations Course

## üìú Introduction

The challenges of programming include **repetition** and **managing large amounts of data**.
* **Loops** are control structures that execute a block of code repeatedly.
* **Arrays** are data structures that store multiple values in a single variable.
* This lesson also introduces **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**, the practice of writing tests before code.

## üíª Loops

Computers are great at repetitive tasks. We can use a **loop** to repeat a set of instructions multiple times.
* **MDN's Looping Code**: Read this resource and tackle the 'Active Learning' sections.
* **JavaScript.info's ‚ÄúLoops: While and For‚Äù**: Another resource with exercises to practice what you learn.

## üì¶ Arrays

Arrays are an **ordered collection of items** (strings, numbers, etc.). They are useful for dealing with large quantities of data.
* **JavaScript Arrays crash course**: A short video overview of arrays.
* **JavaScript.info intro to arrays**: A textual introduction to the topic.
* **JavaScript.info's array method guide**: A deeper look at array methods.
* **MDN's Array documentation**: A key resource to bookmark for future reference.

### ü™Ñ Array Methods

Array methods provide powerful ways to manipulate data.

* **`map()`**: Transforms each element in an array and returns a **new array** with the results. It does not change the original array.
    * Example: `const mappedArr = arr.map((num) => num + 1);`
* **`filter()`**: Creates a **new array** containing only the elements for which a provided callback function returns `true`.
    * Example: `const oddNums = arr.filter(isOdd);`
* **`reduce()`**: Executes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a **single output value**.
    * The callback function takes an **accumulator** and the **current item**.
    * It can take an optional `initialValue`.
    * Example: `const productOfAllNums = arr.reduce((total, currentItem) => total * currentItem, 1);`

## üõ†Ô∏è Test-Driven Development (TDD)

TDD is the practice of writing automated tests that describe how code should work **before** you write the code itself.
* **Advantage**: It's more productive and efficient than manually running code over and over to check if it works.

### Assignment ‚úçÔ∏è

- Practice with JavaScript exercises that contain tests to ensure your code works properly.
- Anywhere you see `return`, it means the function will spit back whatever comes after it.
- Follow the instructions in the `README` of the `javascript-exercises` repository to set up your local environment.
- Complete the following exercises in order:
  - 01_helloWorld
  - 02_addNumbers
  - 03_numberChecker
  - 04_mathEquations
  - 05_joinStrings
- **Note:** Solutions for these exercises can be found in the solution folder of each exercise.

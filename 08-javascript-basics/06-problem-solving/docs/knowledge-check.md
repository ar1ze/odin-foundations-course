#### Question: What are the three stages in the problem solving process?

**Answer:** The three stages are: 1. **Understand** the problem, 2. **Plan** a solution, and 3. **Implement** the plan (often by first writing pseudocode).

**Why:** Following this structured process prevents you from jumping straight into coding without a clear goal, which saves a lot of time and helps you write better, more accurate solutions.

**Remember:** **Understand, Plan, Implement.**

#### Question: Why is it important to clearly understand the problem first?

**Answer:** It's crucial because if you don't fully understand the problem, you'll almost certainly build the wrong solution.

**Why:** Taking the time to be 100% clear on the requirements, inputs, and expected outputs at the start prevents you from wasting hours coding a solution that doesn't actually solve the real problem.

**Remember:** You can't hit a target you don't see. üéØ

#### Question: What can you do to help get a clearer understanding of the problem?

**Answer:** You should think about the problem's inputs and outputs and ask clarifying questions about any constraints or edge cases.

**Why:** This helps you uncover hidden requirements and potential issues before you start planning. Knowing exactly what data you'll receive and what you need to produce is essential.

**Example:** For a function that finds the largest number in a list, you'd ask: "What should happen if the list is empty? Can the list contain things that aren't numbers?"

#### Question: What are some of the things you should do in the planning stage of the problem solving process?

**Answer:** In the planning stage, you should break the problem down into smaller, manageable steps and write out those steps as an algorithm or in pseudocode.

**Why:** Creating a written plan forces you to think through the entire logic before touching a line of code. This plan then acts as a roadmap, guiding you through the implementation and helping you avoid getting stuck.

#### Question: What is an algorithm?

**Answer:** An **algorithm** is a clear, step-by-step set of instructions for solving a specific problem.

**Why:** In programming, your plan for solving a problem *is* your algorithm. It‚Äôs the core logic that you will eventually translate into a programming language.

**Example:** A simple algorithm for doing laundry: 1. Separate clothes by color. 2. Put one pile in the machine. 3. Add detergent. 4. Select a cycle and start.

#### Question: What is pseudocode?

**Answer:** **Pseudocode** is a way of writing out your algorithm using a mix of plain English and code-like syntax.

**Why:** It acts as a bridge between your plan and your actual code. It lets you focus on the logical steps of your solution without getting bogged down by the strict syntax rules of a real programming language.

**Example:**

```
FUNCTION that takes a list of numbers
  SET a variable `largest` to the first number in the list
  LOOP through each number in the list
    IF the current number is greater than `largest`
      SET `largest` to the current number
  RETURN `largest`
```

#### Question: What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?

**Answer:** Breaking down a large problem into smaller pieces makes it much less overwhelming and far easier to solve.

**Why:** Small, well-defined problems are easier to think about, implement correctly, and test. Once you've solved all the small pieces, you can combine them to form the solution to the original complex problem.

**Remember:** How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time. üêò

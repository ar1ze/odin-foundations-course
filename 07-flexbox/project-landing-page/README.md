# Project: Landing Page 📄

---

### Introduction 📝

* Create an entire web page from a provided design.
* You'll receive 2 images: one of the complete website and one with font and color details.
* Don't be afraid to use **Google** or review previous lessons.
* Aim to get the project as close as you can to the design, but don't worry about it being "pixel-perfect."
* Feel free to substitute your own content, images, and play with colors and fonts.

### A Note About Images on the Web 🖼️

* Ensure you have the legal right to use any images you find.
* Credit the creator of the image in a **README** file in your repository.
* Good places to find free-to-use images include **Pexels**, **Pixabay**, and **Unsplash**.

### Setting Up Your Project's GitHub Repository ⚙️

* Set up a **git repository** before starting the project.
* This will act as your portfolio.
* Refer back to the Recipes project for a reminder on how to set it up.

### Assignment 🎯

* **Commit early & often!**
* Download the design images: **Image One (Full Design)** and **Image Two (Color and Fonts)**.
* The project has **4 main sections** (and a footer).
* Our suggestion: Tackle one section at a time, starting with the HTML and then moving to the CSS.
* You only need **one CSS file** for this project.
* Do not worry about making your project look good on a mobile device.
* **Push your work to GitHub** when you finish.

### Viewing Your Project on the Web 🌐

* Publish your site from your GitHub repository to share your work.
* The project will be accessible at `your-github-username.github.io/your-github-repo-name`.
* **Simple publishing steps:**
    1.  Make sure your main HTML file is named `index.html`.
    2.  Go to your GitHub repo's **Settings**.
    3.  Click on **Pages** on the left sidebar.
    4.  Change the **Branch** from **None** to **main** and click **Save**.
    5.  It may take a few minutes to publish.

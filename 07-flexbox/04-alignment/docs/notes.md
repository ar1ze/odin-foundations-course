* `justify-content`: Aligns items along the **main axis**.
* `align-items`: Aligns items along the **cross axis**.
* **Axis Behavior:** The behavior of `justify-content` and `align-items` changes when `flex-direction` is changed.
    * `flex-direction: column` -> `justify-content` aligns vertically, `align-items` aligns horizontally.
    * **Default:** `justify-content` aligns horizontally, `align-items` aligns vertically.

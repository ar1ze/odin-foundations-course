### 💪 Let's Flex!

* Items can "flex" (grow or shrink) based on defined rules.
* Interactive examples are embedded to help you experiment.
* You can edit the examples in CodePen for a full-sized environment.

### 📦 Flex Containers and Flex Items

* Flexbox is a set of properties, not a single one.
* Properties are applied to either the **flex container** or the **flex items**.
* **Flex container**: any element with `display: flex`.
* **Flex item**: any element directly inside a flex container.
* An element can be both a flex container and a flex item, allowing for complex, nested layouts.
